1)Special thanks to Gaurav Sobti from the developer group who delivered me from gradle hell

2)You will need to change the IP address to run the connected tests, if you using an emulator changed GCEAsynceTask to 10.0.2.2. Also detailed in TODO

2A) Connected tests task is called zeTest()

3) Make sure you start the GCE obviously a real life app this won't be an issue

4)Because the Async tasks loads the whole joke object with all jokes included running doesn't take long and therefore there progress bar doesn't really show
